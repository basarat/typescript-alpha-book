# Preface 

A few years ago (at this point 4) I wrote the original [TypeScript Deep Dive](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/). It was geared at the audience that TypeScript needed to capture at that time. They were JavaScript engineers that needed some form to tooling to help them scale their increasingly large codebases. TypeScript was exactly that tool, at that book fills that gap. 

However times have changed. The is a large influx of new JavaScript developers (just new to *JavaScript*) that understand (themselves or by recommendation) the value of a compile time type system for documentation and maintainability. They have the challenge of learning *both* JavaScript *and* TypeScript. This book aims to be that resource.
